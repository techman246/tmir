 ["Sunday Roast" Control Room]
 The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the
front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches,
and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together
creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

 ["Sunday Roast" Weapons Room 1]
 The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a
single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights
are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the
ship is in space.

policy 12
 --------------------------------------------------
 Policy 12: Scripts, Macros, Triggers, and Command Stacking
 --------------------------------------------------
 You are obligated to play Miriani entirely "by hand". This means that you may not use scripts, macros, triggers or command stacking for ANY reason
whatsoever, no matter if it gives you an advantage over other players or not. What may seem innocent to you may cause problems to other players or
staff. A system is in place to help prevent the use of these tools, but it is not perfect. Punishments are at the discretion of the staff, and are
chosen on a case-by-case basis.

 Scripting or using macros and triggers involves automating a portion of the game by causing your client to respond to certain conditions, or to
perform a task that you would normally have to do by hand without any player intervention. For example, a script may allow you to automatically
salvage debris or haul asteroids without typing any commands, or typing less commands. This gives you an unfair advantage over other players.
Anti-idle scripts now fall under this policy, as they allow you to maintain stance bonuses that you otherwise would not be able to maintain.

 Command stacking is the use of a multi-line command line or splitter to send multiple commands to the game at once. This may, for example, allow you
to escape someone waiting to stun you outside of your ship, or to stun an unsuspecting person before they can respond. Typing each command and sending
it to the server before typing your next command is acceptable, whereas typing it all beforehand and pasting it in is not acceptable.

 Command stacking includes typing your commands out in advance and pasting them into the game so they all execute at once. It also includes typing
them in advance and using command recall (usually hitting up and enter) to execute them.

 Using command recall (usually pressing the up arrow and enter) is an area that might cause a bit of confusion. The rule of thumb here is simple: If
what you're doing is going to directly affect another player, you should type the command and NOT recall it. If what you're doing is something
monotonous and entirely innocent, such as walking north, you can use command recall to save yourself hitting n 50 times. 

 Example:
 You know your enemy, Rory Jhan, is standing outside waiting to stun you. You need to get to your ship, The Whoa Man Whoa, to meet your friends. To
accomplish this, you have to type out and enter whoa. You MUST TYPE THESE BY HAND. By pasting commands in, you are essentially writing a script, which
is not acceptable. Similarly, recalling the commands is still giving you an unfair advantage over the other player, unless they're using triggers to
catch you, which are likewise illegal.

 Aliases follow similar rules to command recall. If you're using aliases in a combat situation, or a situation involving another player, it's aga inst
the rules. If you wish to assign an alias to "drink tea", that's fine. But using aliases to shorten commands results in you gaining an unfair
advantage over other players, which is something we'd rather avoid.
